This is an Android Application designed for shop managers to help run their business smoothly. 
The application allows the manager to add and remove products, as well as record details on a particular sale and generate a receipt. 
Similarly, the manager can record the purchases made to calculate the total cost, with a shipping tax included.   
Additionaly, a live dashboard is implemented so real-time statistics like monthly profit and revenue can be viewed.

This application makes use of the MVC architecture which makes the code more reusable and easier to understand.
To add to that, fragments were used to implement most screens, and a navigation drawer was used to allow the user to go between different features easily.
For the backend, a SQLite database was implemented, hence a DBHelper class was used to retrieve, update, insert and delete elements from the database.
